                <h4>Embrace the Confusion</h4>
                <p>Every time that you sit down at your computer is a new opportunity to grow your skills and expand your mind.. So don't take it lightly! You are building your future one key at a time, so embrace the learning curve!</p>

                <p>Learning is a process and it is going to be happening in perpetuity, so take it one day at a time.</p>

                <h4>Full Understanding Comes With Time</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
